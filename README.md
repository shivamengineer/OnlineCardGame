Multiplayer Online Card Game

use node app.js in terminal in folder to run

Game still in progress

In the game, the user should be able to have any number
of decks that behave like a normal deck of playing cards

The user will also be able to create rules for card games
just like they would for a regular deck of cards to then
ideally be able to play any game with standard playing cards

Afterwards, there may be other features added, but that will
be much later
